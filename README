Provides a drop-in user management. Functionality is limited to
adding, editing and deleting users. The data editable is very simple
(email, password, etc.). If you need more then you probably need
something more custom to your app.

Currently we assume the following:

* The models handles password hashing. We just use password=. We
  recommend the authlogic gem to handle this.
* The name of the user is in a field called just "name". We may expand
  this later to support first name and last name as seperate fields
  but for now it is just name. Also we might in the future allow no
  name (just e-mail and password).
* When a user is "deleted". Instead an "active" flag it set to false
  We assume the database defaults to flag to true when a new user is
  created.

For more info on how to setup your app to use this plugin see the
test/test_app_template.rb for details on everything required to make
this gem work on a Rails app (ignoring the parts used to ensure this
plugin loads from a non-standard location).
